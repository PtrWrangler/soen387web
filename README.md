# Running the project
You'll need to make sure to run this in the root of your project.  This will
install all the dependencies (`npm install`) and start the server (`npm start`).

Please note that the `npm run bootstrap` is only required if you do not have the
database locally setup.

  $ npm install
  $ npm run bootstrap
  $ npm start
